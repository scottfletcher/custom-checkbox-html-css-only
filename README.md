Hello :) Welcome to this very simple implementation of a custom checkbox mirroring a native checkbox in plain html and css.

I made the custom checkbox a `label` of the native checkbox, so that clicking on it checks the native checkbox.

I used css stylings to make the custom checkbox appear like it is being selected, checked, unchecked, etc. when in reality, the user is only interacting with the hidden native checkbox.

I did not use any javascript.

Thanks for reading, I look forward to your feedback!
